## Why VoxSherpa?

Most TTS apps make you choose between **quality** and **privacy**. Cloud-based tools like ElevenLabs sound incredible — but they require internet, send your text to remote servers, and charge per character.

**VoxSherpa breaks that tradeoff.**

It runs two professional-grade neural engines entirely on your device:

| Engine | Quality | Speed | Best For |
|--------|---------|-------|----------|
| 🧠 **Kokoro-82M** | Studio-grade · rivals ElevenLabs | Slower on budget hardware | Audiobooks, voiceovers, professional content |
| ⚡ **Piper / VITS** | Natural · clear | Fast on any device | Daily use, quick synthesis |

- **Piper / VITS** — Fast, lightweight, natural. Generates speech in seconds on any Android device.

### 🔒 100% Offline & Private
- All processing happens on your device
- No internet required after model download
- No account, no telemetry, no data collection
- Your text never leaves your phone

### 📦 Model Management
- Download models directly from the app
- Import your own `.onnx` models from local storage
- Multiple models installed simultaneously
- Smart storage tracking

### 🎧 Audio Controls
- Real-time waveform visualization
- Adjustable speed and pitch
- Play, pause, and replay generated audio
- Export as WAV with correct sample rate per model

### 📚 Speech Library
- Save all generated audio locally
- Favorites system for quick access
- View generation history with timestamps
- Voice model attribution per recording

### ⚙️ Smart Settings
- **Smart Punctuation** — natural pauses after sentence breaks

**Built with:**
- [Sherpa-ONNX](https://github.com/k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx) — on-device neural inference
- [Kokoro-82M](https://huggingface.co/hexgrad/Kokoro-82M) — multilingual neural TTS model
- [Piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper) — fast local TTS
- Android AudioTrack API — low-latency PCM playback
- [Sketchware Pro](https://github.com/Sketchware-Pro/Sketchware-Pro) — Android IDE used to build this app

## Performance

Generation speed depends entirely on your device's processor:

| Device Tier | Kokoro | Piper |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| 🟢 Flagship (Snapdragon 8 Gen 3) | ~20–40 sec/min audio | ~5 sec/min audio |
| 🟡 Mid-range (8-core) | ~60–90 sec/min audio | ~10 sec/min audio |
| 🔴 Budget (6-core) | ~2–3 min/min audio | ~20 sec/min audio |

> Kokoro prioritizes **quality over speed** by design. It uses the same 82M parameter architecture that powers premium commercial TTS — running it entirely offline on a mobile CPU is genuinely pushing the hardware limits.

## Installation

### 🧪 Help Me Reach Google Play — Join the Beta!

I've submitted **VoxSherpa TTS V2.1** to Google Play, but according to Play Store rules, I need at least **12 testers for 14 days** before I can publish to production.

If you find this project useful and want early access to V2.1 — I'd really appreciate your help. All you need to do is install the app and keep it for 14 days. You don't have to do anything else.

**What's new in V2.1:**
- 🔊 System-wide TTS engine — use VoxSherpa in any app (Chrome, WhatsApp, etc.)
- 📄 PDF to Audio
- 💾 Export audio as FLAC / M4A (in addition to WAV)

**How to join:**
1. Fill out the form below with your Gmail
2. I'll add you manually to the closed test
3. You'll receive a Play Store opt-in link

> Source code for V2.0 and V2.1 will be pushed to GitHub after beta testing is complete.

### F-Droid
> Coming Soon — F-Droid version uses GitHub-hosted model list instead of Firebase — fully FOSS compliant, GPL v3.0 licensed.
